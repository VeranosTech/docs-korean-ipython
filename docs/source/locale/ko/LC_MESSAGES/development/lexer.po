"Previously, the :class:`IPythonConsoleLexer` class was available at "
":mod:`IPython.sphinxext.ipython_console_hightlight`.  It was inserted "
"into Pygments' list of available lexers under the name `ipython`.  It "
"should be mentioned that this name is inaccurate, since an IPython "
"console session is not the same as IPython code (which itself is a "
"superset of the Python language)."

#: ../../source/development/lexer.rst:36
msgid ""
"Now, the Sphinx extension inserts two console lexers into Pygments' list "
"of available lexers. Both are IPyLexer instances under the names: "
"`ipython` and `ipython3`. Although the names can be confusing (as "
"mentioned above), their continued use is, in part, to maintain backwards "
"compatibility and to aid typical usage. If a project needs to make "
"Pygments aware of more than just the IPyLexer class, then one should not "
"make the IPyLexer class available under the name `ipython` and use `ipy` "
"or some other non-conflicting value."
