"IPython 6 requires Python 3, so our compatibility module "

" version. In most cases, we recommend you use the `six module "

"widely used by other projects, so it is familiar to many developers and "
"thoroughly battle-tested."

"Our ``py3compat`` module provided some more specific unicode conversions "
"than those offered by ``six``. If you want to use these, copy them into "
