"IPython was starting in 2001 by Fernando Perez while he was a graduate "
"student at the University of Colorado, Boulder. IPython as we know it "
"today grew out of the following three projects:"

"ipython by Fernando PÃ©rez. Fernando began using Python and ipython began "
"as an outgrowth of his desire for things like Mathematica-style prompts, "
"access to previous output (again like Mathematica's % syntax) and a "
"flexible configuration system (something better than "
":envvar:`PYTHONSTARTUP`)."

"IPP by Janko Hauser. Very well organized, great usability. Had an old "
"help system. IPP was used as the \"container\" code into which Fernando "
"added the functionality from ipython and LazyPython."

"LazyPython by Nathan Gray. Simple but very powerful. The quick syntax "
"(auto parens, auto quotes) and verbose/colored tracebacks were all taken "

"When I found out about IPP and LazyPython I tried to join all three into "
"a unified system. I thought this could provide a very nice working "
"environment, both for regular programming and scientific computing: "
"shell-like features, IDL/Matlab numerics, Mathematica-type prompt history"
" and great object introspection and help facilities. I think it worked "
"reasonably well, though it was a lot more work than I had initially "
"planned."
