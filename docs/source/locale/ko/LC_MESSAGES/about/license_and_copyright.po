"IPython uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains "
"copyright over their contributions to IPython. But, it is important to "
"note that these contributions are typically only changes (diffs/commits) "
"to the repositories. Thus, the IPython source code, in its entirety is "
"not the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the"
" collective copyright of the entire IPython Development Team. If "
"individual contributors want to maintain a record of what "
"changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should "
"indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they "
"commit the change to one of the IPython repositories."
