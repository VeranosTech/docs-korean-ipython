"This is mostly work 'under the hood', but it is actually a *major* "
"achievement for the project that has deep implications in the long term: "
"at last, we have unified the main object that executes as the user's "
"interactive shell (which we refer to as the *IPython kernel*) with the "
"objects that run in all the worker nodes of the parallel computing "
"facilities (the *IPython engines*).  Ever since the first implementation "
"of IPython's parallel code back in 2006, we had wanted to have these two "
"roles be played by the same machinery, but a number of technical reasons "
"had prevented that from being true."
