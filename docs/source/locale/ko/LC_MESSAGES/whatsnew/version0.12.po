"This Notebook is a major milestone for IPython, as for years we have "

"years we have seen the excellent implementation offered by the `Sage "
"<http://sagemath.org>` system. But we continued to work on something that"
" would be consistent with the rest of IPython's design, and it is clear "
"now that the effort was worth it: based on the ZeroMQ communications "
"architecture introduced in version 0.11, the notebook can now retain 100%"
" of the features of the real IPython.  But it can also provide the rich "
