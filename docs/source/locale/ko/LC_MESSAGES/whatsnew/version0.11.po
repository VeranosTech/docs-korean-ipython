"IPython 0.11 is a *major* overhaul of IPython, two years in the making.  "

"relatively quick succession of releases, as people discover new bugs and "
"regressions.  Once we iron out any significant bugs in this process and "

"**Standalone Qt console**: a new rich console has been added to IPython, "
"started with `ipython qtconsole`.  In this application we have tried to "
"retain the feel of a terminal for fast and efficient workflows, while "
"adding many features that a line-oriented terminal simply can not "
"support, such as inline figures, full multiline editing with syntax "

"versions used the Twisted networking framework.  While this change will "
"require users to update their codes, the improvements in performance, "
"memory control and internal consistency across our codebase convinced us "
"it was a price worth paying.  We have tried to explain how to best "
"proceed with this update, and will be happy to answer questions that may "

"**New model for GUI/plotting support in the terminal**.  Now instead of "
"the various `-Xthread` flags we had before, GUI support is provided "
"without the use of any threads, by directly integrating GUI event loops "
"with Python's `PyOS_InputHook` API.  A new command-line flag `--gui` "
"controls GUI support, and it can also be enabled after IPython startup "
"via the new `%gui` magic. This requires some changes if you want to "
"execute GUI-using scripts inside IPython, see :ref:`the GUI support "

"impervious to the Python Global Interpreter Lock because they take place "
"in a system-level C++ thread.  The impact of the GIL in our previous code"
" was something we could simply not work around, given that Twisted is "
