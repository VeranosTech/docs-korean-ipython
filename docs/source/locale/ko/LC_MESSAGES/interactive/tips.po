"Run your doctests from within IPython for development and debugging. The "
"special %doctest_mode command toggles a mode where the prompt, output and"
" exceptions display matches as closely as possible that of the default "
"Python interpreter. In addition, this mode allows you to directly paste "
"in code that contains leading '>>>' prompts, even if they have extra "
"leading whitespace (as is common in doctest files). This combined with "
"the ``%history -t`` call to see your translated history allows for an "
"easy doctest workflow, where you can go from doctest to interactive "
"execution to pasting into valid Python code as needed."

"Put a ';' at the end of a line to suppress the printing of output. This "

"When you call ``%edit`` with no arguments, IPython opens an empty editor "
"with a temporary file, and it returns the contents of your editing "
"session as a string variable. Thanks to IPython's output caching "
"mechanism, this is automatically stored::"

"Now, if you call ``%edit -p``, IPython tries to open an editor with the "
"same data as the last time you used %edit. So if you haven't used %edit "
"in the meantime, this same contents will reopen; however, it will be done"
" in a new file. This means that if you make changes and you later want to"
" find an old version, you can always retrieve it by using its output "
"number, via '%edit _NN', where NN is the number of the output prompt."
